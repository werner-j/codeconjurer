1. About
========
Code Conjurer is a software reuse tool developed at the chair for software engineering at the University of Mannheim.

The Eclipse plug-in brings the power of the merobase.com software search engine to the popular Eclipse IDE. If enabled, a background agent monitors the programming activities of a Java developer and searches for appropriate reusable software artifacts that fit the current class under development.
